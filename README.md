### Basic Commands
1. `yarn install` install the dependencys.
2. `yarn start` in the Frontend directory starts the react app on port 3000.
3. `yarn start` in the Backend directory starts the express server on port 5000.
4. `yarn build` in the Frontend directory trigger a production build for the Frontend.

2. switch to the Frontend directory with `cd Frontend`, followed by `yarn install` install the dependencys. Repeat this in the Backend directory.
3. in both directorys change the name of `example.env` to `.env`. To edit the files use your favourite editor like <code>nano</code>. <b>it is important to set the email settings, otherwise the reset password function will not work!</b>
